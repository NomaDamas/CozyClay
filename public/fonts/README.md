# Bundled fonts

The `.woff2` files in this directory are redistributed with CozyClay under the
SIL Open Font License 1.1. Each family has its upstream OFL text beside the
font files. The existing Inter and Instrument Serif files remain until their
later cleanup todo.

The IBM Plex Sans files are the upstream Latin1 webfont subsets. Korean text
continues through the Pretendard and Noto Sans KR fallbacks in `--sans`.
Under the OFL, a modified copy may not use the Reserved Font Name, so if a
subset is ever renamed or edited beyond subsetting, check clause 3 before
shipping it.
