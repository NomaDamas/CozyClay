 * staged. The walls are gone: the stage is now a near-infinite open deck —
 * large enough that no ordinary blocking ever meets its edge — and enclosure,
 * when a shot needs it, comes from placed set pieces instead of the stage.
 *
 * Dimensions are metres. The floor is deliberately finite (a plane, not a
 * shader-infinite grid) so exports keep a clean horizon and the framing math
 * never meets an unbounded surface.

// which costs an exported blocking frame two depth cues at once: the falloff
// that says how far away the floor is, and the contact shading that says the
// subject is standing ON it rather than floating. The colour is lifted to
// compensate for the shading the lambert term now applies, so the deck keeps
// the same on-screen brightness it had while unlit.

 * A GridHelper is a separate object a couple of millimetres over a 500 m
 * plane, and at that separation it loses to the floor across almost the whole
 * frame — it survives only where the surface is grazed near the horizon, which
 * is exactly where it is useless. Drawing the lines in the floor's own shader
 * ends the contest: the marks ARE the surface, so they cannot z-fight with it,
 * cannot be sorted behind it, and shade, shadow and fog exactly as the deck
 * does.
 *
 * Computed per pixel from the world position, not baked into a tiled texture:
 * a texture blurred its lines up close and mip-averaged them into a grey
 * moire toward the horizon. Here every line is ~1 px wide at any distance
 * (fwidth), and a line family fades out once its spacing drops under a few
 * pixels, so the far deck is clean floor instead of a band of noise.
